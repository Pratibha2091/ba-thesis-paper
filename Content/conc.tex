\chapter{Conclusion}

To conclude in this thesis optimal procurement strategy is presented under the problem formulation. The problem setting isn't general enough to engulf set up cost, but otherwise general enough to apply to real world scenario.
Since main scope of this thesis is optimal procurement planning, time series forecasting basics are included for completeness, and by improving that part of data processing pipeline better results can be obtained.
Finally here analyzed dataset is sufficiently simple that simple approach yields decent procurement planning.
