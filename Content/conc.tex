\chapter{Conclusion}

Every part of the data processing pipeline is important for good results. Beginning with measuring/estimating supply cost and demand quantities to its subsequent processing. Each pipeline part could improve or diminish model results.

The thesis primary focus is on determining optimal procurement under model stated at the beginning, however as all models it's only mathematical approximation of the real world.

Bulk cost discount, set up costs and other various real life complexities are beyond it. Nevertheless, usefulness of approximation is in its application -- does it solve problem at hand good enough? The answer is yes.The model described indeed is good enough approximation for many real world problems, therefore yielding this analysis useful in the real world scenario.

However it's far from most complex model and most descriptive one. There's always trade of between model complexity and speed. Problem as presented has known polynomial time solution which makes it feasible for large dataset and planning horizons. As a side note, forecasting longer time horizons bring problems and great uncertainties of their own.

Bottom line this model is quick and rather simple to apply. For greatest applicability supply costs and demand quantities should be estimated using best possible methods from other mathematical field.
