\label{sec:Newsvendor model}

The newsvendor model~\autocite{Arrow1974} is a mathematical model resambling newsvendor stand. The problem is characterized by fixed prices and uncertain demand for a perishable product, e.g. yesterdays newspapers hold no value today. Demand for newspapers is uncertain and newsvendor must decide how many newspaper to buy for reselling.

The stock in newsvendor model is only for one day, and unlike problem presented in chapter~\ref{chap:prob-def} product is not perishable, but its cost increases in each following time step.
