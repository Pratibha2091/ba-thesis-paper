\section{Solution}
Under assumption $\mathbf{s}$, $c$ and $\mathbf{d}$ are already defined (in here are simply defined for example

This solution has running time of $\Theta(n)$

\section{Variation}
If we add additional constraint:
\[
    \forall t: h_t \le H
\]

it's possible to solve this probelm in $\mathcal{O}(nH^2)$ time using dynamic programming. Our state in dynamic programing $\mathrm{dp}_{t,i}$ is minumal cost where at time $t$ we have $i$ units stored in storage, that is $h_t = i$.

Transition is:

\[
    \mathrm{dp}_{t,i} = \min_{j=0}^{i}{
        cj
        + \mathrm{dp}_{t-1, j}
        + s_t \left( d_t + i - j \right) }
\]

For finding optimal solution we're interested in optimal $j$ choices in recursive tree for $\mathrm{dp}_{n, 0}$ that is at time $t$ we have 0 product surplus stored in storage.

Likewise there exeist minimum $H$ such that $\forall h > H$ optimal solution doesn't change. Using expoentially increasing $H$ it's possible to find optimal $H$ in $\mathcal{O}(nH^2\log H)$ time.
