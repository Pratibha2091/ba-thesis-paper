\begin{abstract}
Optimal procurement in most industries involves forecasting of two
quantities: prices of raw materials and customer's demand.  The aim of
this work is to integrate forecasts into production planning models,
with the aim of minimizing overall procurement, holding and production
costs under demand satisfaction constraints.  The decision support
system should allow the decision maker to integrate qualitative,
unstructured information through a simple interface, for scenario
selection and solution refinement.
